**Day Twenty Eight - 30 days of React challenge - MERN stack backend for a 'note to self' app**

Playing around with MERN backends, writing one from scratch and researching all the elements involved so I understand exactly what goes on under the hood for future projects!

**Concepts Explored:** 

- What is a MERN stack
- Server setup, database, middleware, general config
- Schema w Mongoose
- Writing HTTP requests
- HTTP requests with Postman

Follow me as I self-learn React.js. Each day for thirty days i'll be creating a simple app and posting about it, (attempting to) explain my code, and discuss what I have learned. By the end of day 30 I hope to have a basic working knowledge of React.js and its applications!
